# this asks the user for a number and turns the answer
# into an integer

n = int(input("How many times should I loop? "))

# Now, print "Hello, World!" n times.
for x in range(n):
    print("Hello, World!")

# range takes three arguments, where should it start, where should it end, and lastly step size. range(start,end,stepsize)
